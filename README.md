## Overview
Adds breath to the player character (any personality) and voice (via text file, by default only few personalities, more can be added manually).

The functional is analogues to KK_MaleMoan, breaking player character's silence or that of a camera if the character is hidden, with the differences being:
* Alternative/considerably more variable breaths aka huffs and puffs during H Scene
* Custom voice replies, while still requiring to be hand picked via in-game files and placed accordingly, 
now are driven by button clicks (VR has them integrated in the controller input) and robust conditions that mostly eliminate the cacophony of simultaneously played voice lines by multiple characters.

Integrated into [KK(S)_VR](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KKS_VR) and [SensibleH](https://github.com/lotsofbears/KK_SensibleH)

Comes together with an example file how to add custom voices for any personality.
